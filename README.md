# Sample-Superstore-Analysis
Using Tableau's sample superstore data, I was able to clean, organize, and visualize data in order to make recommendations for business optimization
- I used excel for cleaning, SQL for organization, and Tableau for visualization
- I was able to analyze quarterly performance, find products that are operating at a net loss, and identify other areas of improvement
- Highlighting these problem areas would allow the superstore to make data-driven decisions that increase their total sales and corresponding profits
